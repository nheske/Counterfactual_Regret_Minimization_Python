### Introduction
Based on https://github.com/andyliu42/Counterfactual_Regret_Minimization_Python

I am adding a lot of comments as I am learning what this does so that when I get to the holdem code I can describe in a poker player's parlance what that code is doing.

This repository contains the example code of regret minimiaztion solving Rock-Paper-Scissors and Kuhn poker problems.

* Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS)
    * Self training
    * Finding RPS Equilibrium
* Kuhn poker
    * Self training
* Tic-Tac-Toe
    * based on https://towardsdatascience.com/counterfactual-regret-minimization-ff4204bf4205
* Swindler - Is there an optimal strategy for this
